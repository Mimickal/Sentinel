# Heuristic rules for calculating user suspicion.
#
# YOUR SPECIFIC RULES SHOULD BE KEPT PRIVATE, so people can't game them!
#
# "version" is the version number of these rules.
# This version number is printed alongside every suspicious user report,
# which allows reports to be correlated with the rules used to determine them.
# Therefore, this version should be incremented every time the rules are changed.
#
# "rules" is an array of objects with the following structure keys:
#
#   path:
#   The path of the property to access, starting at "member".
#   You can define multiple rules for one path.
#   example: member.user.avatar
#
#   value:
#   The accessed property is checked against this value. If the values match,
#   the score is applied. If the property is a function, the function is called.
#   The property (or returned value) will be casted to match this value's type.
#   This can also be given as an object containing a "min" and a "max" field.
#   In this case, the min and max must both be numbers.
#
#   score:
#   The number added to the overall suspicion score. This value can be positive
#   or negative.
#   This can also be given as an object containing a "min" and a "max" field.
#   In this case, "value" must also be using "min" and "max", and the score
#   will be applied as a range based on "value".
